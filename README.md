# Subsets-Subarrays-Subsequences
Here I will be Uploading all the problems of Subsequence ,subarrays and subsets.

> 1.subset return using a 2 dimensional array which is dynamically allocated
    
    
    input:
           
            3
            1 2 3
     output:

             3
             2
             2 3
             1
             1 3
             1 2
             1 2 3
> 2.subset return using a 2 dimensioinal vector
> 3.subset print using a single dimensional array
> 4. subset return which sums up to K
    
     
     input: 
     
            4
            2 1 3 2
            4
     
     output:
     
           2 2 
           1 3
           
> 5.subset print which sums up to K

I will be adding rest of the problems soon!!
